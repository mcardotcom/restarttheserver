1. Executive Summary
RESTART_ The Server is an AI-enhanced news aggregator designed to combat information overload for tech enthusiasts, professionals, and investors. In a media landscape saturated with clickbait and low-value content, readers need a reliable filter to identify the most important developments in technology, AI, and startups.

This document outlines the product requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) launch and a phased roadmap for future enhancements.

1.1. Problem Statement
The modern tech news cycle is overwhelming. Readers spend significant time sifting through noise to find impactful stories, while publishers struggle to make important content stand out. There is a need for a curated platform that uses intelligent systems to surface high-signal news, saving readers time and helping them stay genuinely informed.

1.2. Solution & Vision
RESTART_ will provide a clean, scannable, "Drudge Report-style" feed of tech news. It will leverage AI to analyze, summarize, and rank stories by their significance, using a "Flame Score" (ðŸ”¥) system. The MVP will launch as an automated news digest, with a future-state vision of becoming a premier, real-time source for critical tech news, complete with community features and premium content.

1.3. Goals & Objectives (Phase 1: Launch)
Product Goal: Launch a stable, automated, AI-curated news digest that provides daily value to users.

Business Goal: Validate the core concept and begin building a niche audience. Establish a foundation for future monetization.

Technical Goal: Deploy a scalable and maintainable application on Vercel using the specified Next.js and Supabase stack.

Security Goal: Launch with a secure, authenticated admin panel and a documented process for managing vulnerabilities.

2. Target Audience
Primary: Tech Professionals (Engineers, PMs), Startup Founders, Venture Capitalists, and avid tech enthusiasts.

Secondary: Journalists, students, and anyone with a keen interest in the future of technology.

User Story

Acceptance Criteria

CORE-01

As a reader, I want to see a feed of headlines prioritized by importance so I can quickly understand what matters most.

- Headlines are grouped into sections: "High Priority," "Worth Reading," & "Also Happening." 
 - Each headline displays a "Flame Score" (1-5).

CORE-02

As a reader, I want to click on a headline and be taken to the original source article to read the full story.

- All headlines are external links that open in a new tab.

CORE-03

As an editor, I want the system to automatically fetch relevant news articles from trusted sources.

- A cron job runs hourly to call the Newsdata.io API for articles with keywords like "AI," "Tech," and "Startups."

CORE-04

As an editor, I want the system to automatically analyze and score each new article.

- For each new article, the system calls the OpenAI API to generate a summary and a hype score. 
 - The analyzed article is saved to the database as a draft.

CORE-05

As an editor, I want to view all fetched articles in an admin panel to curate the feed.

- The /admin page displays a list of all headlines. 
 - Each item shows its title, source, summary, and AI-generated score.

AUTH-01

As an editor, I want to securely log in to the admin panel to manage content.

- The /admin route is protected and requires user authentication via Supabase Auth. 
 - A simple login page exists at /login. 
 - Unauthorized users attempting to access /admin are redirected to /login.

DATA-01

As a reader, I want the feed to feel fresh and not be cluttered with old news.

- The public feed only displays articles published within the last 48 hours.

MON-01

As an editor, I want to place ads on the site to generate revenue.

- The layout includes dedicated, non-intrusive ad slots.

User Story

Acceptance Criteria

REALTIME-01

As an editor, I want to manually add a breaking news story so it appears on the site instantly.

- A bookmarklet allows one-click pre-filling of the admin form. 
 - The admin form includes a "Breaking" status option.

AUTH-02

As a lead editor, I want to invite other editors to the platform.

- An interface exists within the admin panel to manage user roles and send invitations.

DATA-02

As an editor, I want an automated script to archive old articles but have the ability to pin important stories.

- A daily script sets published=false for articles older than 3 days. 
 - A "Pinned" option prevents the script from archiving a specific article.

COMM-01

As a reader, I want to receive a daily summary of the top news via email.

- A newsletter signup form is available. 
 - A daily email digest is sent to subscribers.

4. Design & UX Requirements
Layout: Clean, minimalist, single-column, text-focused layout inspired by the Drudge Report.

Theme: Dark mode by default to reduce eye strain.

Typography: Highly legible, sans-serif font (Inter). Clear visual hierarchy for headlines, summaries, and sources.

Branding: The logo is "RESTART_" with the underscore in a distinct color (red). The "Flame Score" is a core visual element.

5. Technology Stack
Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)

Database & Auth: Supabase

AI/LLM: OpenAI API (GPT-4)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Deployment: Vercel

Content Sourcing: Newsdata.io API

6. Success Metrics
Engagement:

Daily Active Users (DAU)

Click-Through Rate (CTR) on headlines

Average time on site

Content:

Number of headlines published per day

Business (Post-Monetization):

Ad revenue

Newsletter subscribers (for V2)

7. Assumptions, Risks, and Dependencies
Assumptions:

Users will find value in an AI-curated digest over unfiltered social media feeds.

The Newsdata.io free tier will provide sufficient article volume for the MVP.

Risks:

Third-Party Service Dependency: The project's functionality and security are dependent on external services (Supabase, OpenAI, Newsdata.io). Any downtime, security breach, or change in terms from these providers directly impacts the application.

AI Cost: Costs for the OpenAI API could become significant if traffic scales rapidly.

Competition: The news aggregation space is highly competitive.

Dependencies:

The project is dependent on the uptime and API terms of Supabase, OpenAI, Newsdata.io, and Vercel.

A 12-hour delay in the free Newsdata.io feed is a known constraint for the MVP.
